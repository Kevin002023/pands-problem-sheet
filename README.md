## **Week01 - helloworld.py**

I created a programme that when initiated would present the user with the message "Hello World!"

This was done by following [the week one lecture](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5db36fd4-f7b5-42dd-925f-87b7530c1b2f)

### **Week02 - bank.py**

I created a programme, that would prompt the user to enter two monetary amounts in cents, then add these together and then present them in a euro format to two decimal places.

This was done by following [the week two lecture](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a837d9b7-e63f-4df7-942f-461aade818e9)

However whenever the cent amount was a multiple of ten the programme would only output to 1 decimal place. I was able to correct this using the following [resource](https://pythonguides.com/python-print-2-decimal-places/) 

The code " format_b = "{:.2f}".format(b)"  ensures you get an output to 2 decimal places.
